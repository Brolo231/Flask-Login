Once the file structure has been set up and each file contains it's appropriate code we can run our application in DEBUG mode so that any changes made to the content of the files will be updated in real time on the web application.

By default our web application will be run on the local server which we can paste into our browser and load the web application. Notice in the URL bar that we are running on the local host.
